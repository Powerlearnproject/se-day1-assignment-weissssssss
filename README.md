Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles,methods and tools to the development and maintenance of high quality sofware systems.
It plays a crucial part in the technology industry since it enables the creation of software applications & systems that play a major role in modern life.
Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1.They include the development of programming languages such as C anf Fortran.

2.The establishment of Software Engineering as a discipline in the 1960s

3.The rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1.Requirements-It involves gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
2.Design-This involves creating detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
3.Development-Involves writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
4.Testing-This involves Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
5.Deployment-This is simply releasing the software to the users or customers.
6.Maintenance-This involves providing ongoing support, updates and enhancements to the software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
-Waterfall methodology is a sequential approach with distinct pases flowing down like a waterfall which would be useful in solitary projects,whereas agile methodology
 is an iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration, and responding to change which i think would be more useful in projects where you have
 to work in collaboration with others.
 
Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
1.Software Developer-Responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
2.Quality Assuarance Engineer-Is responsible for ensuring software quality by designing and executing test plans.
3.Project Manager-Is Responsible for overseeing the planning, execution and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
-They enhance productivity, collaboration and code quality by providing developers with features such as code editors, version control, debugging tools, and automated testing capabilities.
-Examples of IDEs include Visual studio code while an example a Version Control System is git.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
1.Changing Requirements-Requirements may change during the development cycle leading to scope creep and project delays.
2.Tight Deadlines-Pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed development and compromised quality.
3.Technical Debt-Accrued from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions,technical debt can impede future development efforts and increase maintenance costs.

-Strategies to overcome these problems innclude;
1.effective communication.
2.Agile methodologies.
3.Prioritization of tasks.
4.Regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
1.Unit testing-Involves testing individual components or modules of software.
2.Integration testing-Involves testing interactions between different components or subsystems.
3.System testing-Is testing the entire software system as a whole.
4.Acceptance testing-Involves testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.

-The importance of testing is that it helps identify and fix defects early in the development process leading to higher-quality software products.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
-It invoves crafting statements to get the best possible results from AI models.
-It's importance is that it helps improve the interactions between us humans and AI.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
-I can ask tell me about Kenya and the AI might end up giving me a vague answer but instead if i ask tell me about the history of Kenya i will get a more precise answer.Thus
the improved prompt is better since it helps me get a more precise and accurate answer.
